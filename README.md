Hello all! 

I've joined Github to learn more about this computer science world and hopefully gain some needed experience. I'm in school right now, studying for my computer science degree, but I need to practice coding and I figured this would be the best way to further my education. I appreciate any help that comes my way, and as soon as I am able to, I will pass that knowledge along to future programmers. 

I look forward to working with all of you.
